# ============================================================
# main.py — Application Entry Point
# ============================================================
# This is the first file FastAPI reads when the server starts.
# It creates the FastAPI app instance and registers everything.
#
# IMPORTS FROM: app/database.py (engine, Base)
#               app/models/user.py (User table)
#               app/models/otp.py  (OTP table)
# IMPORTED BY:  nothing — this is the top of the chain
#
# STARTUP SEQUENCE:
#   1. Models are imported → they register themselves with Base
#   2. create_all() sees all registered models → creates tables
#   3. FastAPI app is created
#   4. Routers are registered (we'll add these soon)
#   5. Server starts listening for requests
